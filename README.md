# Catalog Project - Hosted

## SSH connection 
IP: 18.130.116.182  
Port: 22

## URL to hosted web application
http://18.130.116.182.xip.io

## Notes from me
Despite following all instructions and tutorials the port will not change for ssh. The application cannot access the database file despite changing all permissions to allow it to do so. I have spent a crazy amount of time trying to get this to work. Worked around a ridiculous amount of errors and problems and finally came to one I can't fix.

## Setup:
Followed the setup course for linux webserver on Udacity [here](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud299)  
- The web applications files are in /var/www/itemcatalog/itemcatalog  
- The WSGI file is in /var/www/itemcatalog and is called 'myapp.wsgi'  
- The virtual machine created is called flask



## Software:  
- python
